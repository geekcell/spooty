# Spooty - selfhosted Spotify downloader
Spooty is a self-hosted Spotify downloader.
It allows download track/playlist/album from the Spotify url.
It can also subscribe to a playlist or author page and download new songs upon release.
Spooty basically downloads nothing from Spotify, it only gets information from spotify and then finds relevant and downloadeds music on Youtube. 
The project is based on NestJS and Angular.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not use this tool for piracy! Download only music you own rights! Use this tool only on your responsibility.

## 🚀 Installation
Recommended and the easiest way how to start to use of Spooty is using docker.

> [!NOTE]
> This fork does not require a Spotify Developer application. It reads playlist
> metadata using an anonymous Spotify embed token, so there is no
> `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` or `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` to configure.

### Docker

This fork does not publish an image to Docker Hub, so build it locally first:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dougchansan/spooty.git
cd spooty
docker build -t spooty .
```

For detailed configuration, see available [environment variables](#environment-variables).

#### Docker command
```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/spooty/backend/downloads \
  -v /path/to/cookies.txt:/spooty/cookies.txt:ro \
  spooty
```

#### Docker compose
```yaml
services:
  spooty:
    image: spooty
    container_name: spooty
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/downloads:/spooty/backend/downloads
      - /path/to/cookies.txt:/spooty/cookies.txt:ro
    environment:
      # Configure other environment variables if needed
      - DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=2
```

### Build from source

Spooty can be also build from source files on your own.

#### Requirements
- Node v20.20.0 (it is recommended to use `nvm` node version manager to install proper version of node)
- Redis in memory cache
- Ffmpeg
- Python3

#### Process
- install Node v20.20.0 using `nvm install` and use that node version `nvm use`
- from project root install all dependencies using `npm install`
- copy `.env.default` as `.env` in `src/backend` folder and modify desired environment properties (see [environment variables](#environment-variables))
- build source files `npm run build`
    - built project will be stored in `dist` folder
- start server `npm run start`

### Environment variables

Some behaviour and settings of Spooty can be configured using environment variables and `.env` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY`, `DOWNLOAD_GAP_MS` and `SEARCH_CONCURRENCY` are the
> exception: they are read at module-import time, before the `.env` file is
> loaded, so putting them in `.env` has no effect. Pass them as real environment
> variables (`docker run -e ...`, compose `environment:`, or `export`). All
> other variables in this table work in `.env` as usual.

> [!WARNING]
> YouTube rate-limits a session for up to an hour after roughly 100 rapid
> downloads, and tracks that fail this way stay in an error state until they are
> retried. The defaults above are deliberately conservative for that reason.
> Raise them only if you are willing to trade stalled downloads for speed.

### How to supply your YouTube cookies

Some downloads are restricted unless the request is authenticated. Spooty passes
a cookies file straight to `yt-dlp`, which expects **Netscape format** — not the
`name=value; name=value` string used by older versions of these instructions.

1. Install a "cookies.txt" browser extension that exports in Netscape format.
2. Go to https://www.youtube.com and log in if needed.
3. Export the cookies for that domain to a file named `cookies.txt`.
4. Mount that file into the container at `/spooty/cookies.txt`, as shown in the
   [Docker](#docker) examples above.

> [!CAUTION]
> This file contains live Google account session cookies, not just YouTube ones.
> Anyone who obtains it can access your Google account without a password.
> Store it outside your repository, never commit it, never paste its contents
> into a chat, issue, or web form, and mount it read-only (`:ro`) so the
> container cannot modify it. Prefer exporting from a throwaway Google account.
> Bake it into an image only if you are certain that image will never be shared —
> image layers preserve it even if a later layer deletes the file.
